CardSpotter Privacy Policy

When enabled CardSpotter injects code into the current web page that reads the content of HTML5 videos. It is either extracted automatically for automatic tooltips or on demand for the click mode. This video data is processed locally to extract subsections of the image which are then matched vs a local database of image hashes. If there is a match the corresponding image url for the https://www.scryfall.com image database is used to fetch a large image.

CardSpotter also uses chrome.storage to store user settings.
